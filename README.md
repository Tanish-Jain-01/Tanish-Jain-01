### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Tanish Jain, and I am currently a undergraduate university student studying at BITS Pilani.
I am fairly well versed in Python, and I am interested in learning C, C++ and Javescript! I like programming competitively (although I have a lot to improve at ðŸ˜…).
I am also interested in learning game development - I would love to express my creativity though creating games!
I'm looking for opportunities for personal and professional growth âœ¨
